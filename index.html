        <p class="l">Kazakhstan will be the first country in the world to locally produce Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus

            scandal grows</h1>
        <p class="l">Peru appointed its sixth foreign minister in less than a year following a fresh resignation over a
            <br> growing coronavirus vaccinations scandal.

        </p>
        <p class="l">Veteran diplomat Allan Wagner, 79, was sworn in less than 24 hours after Elizabeth Astete became
            <br> the second top official to step down over the scandal, Reuters reported programme.

        </p>
        <p class="l">Peru has been gripped in recent days by the news that government officials received the Covid-19
            <br> vaccination weeks or even months before the South American country launched its immunisation .

        </p>
        <p class="l">Health minister Pilar Mazzetti stepped down last week following a newspaper report that former <br>
            president Martin Vizcarra had received a shot of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in October. <br> Peru only
            began its immunisation drive, starting with healthcare workers, in early February <br>after receiving
            300,000 doses of vaccine.
